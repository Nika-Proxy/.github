A residential proxy that matches a real browser at every layer of the stack — not just the User-Agent string, not just the source IP. We sign outbound TLS handshakes with configurable browser profiles, control the TCP window/MSS pattern via T4-T7 exit coordination, and emit HTTP/2 frames in real-browser order. Anti-bot systems that fingerprint at L4 + L5 + L7 see what they expect to see.

## What we ship

- **67+ TLS profiles** — Chrome 131, Firefox 124, Safari 17, mobile Safari, OkHttp, Fuel, Volley, node-fetch, Go net/http, more
- **50M+ residential IPs** across 195+ countries via residential routing
- **TCP fingerprint coordination** — Win11 / mobile / iOS exits matched to the browser profile at handshake time
- **Sticky or rotating sessions** — sub-second swap, customer-pickable lifetime
- **REST scrape API** — fire-and-forget URL → JSON, no proxy plumbing
- **HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy** — drop-in replacement for whatever client you're already using
- **Pay-as-you-go from $2/GB** — bandwidth credit, never expires; TLS engine is a separate subscription tier

## What we don't open-source

The engine. The TLS profiles. The T4-T7 coordinator. The prober. These are the moat.

What we *do* publish — the example code, the docs, the educational guides, the market research data — is the on-ramp + the reason people in the anti-bot ecosystem talk to us. Use it, file issues, send PRs. The engine itself stays in the vault.
